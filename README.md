# **POKÉMON PROJECT**

### FEATURES:

1. Connects to the Pokémon trading card game API to randomly load 60 cards.
2. Cards can be clicked on to open a modal which contains more details about the selected card.
3. Card info is color-coded for legibility.
4. App is fully responsive and should look good on most mobile devices.
5. Clicking on the Generate New Deck button reloads a random deck of cards.

#### POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATES:

1. A search function to allow users to search for cards based on names, sets, etc.
2. Increase responsiveness by adding more viewport breakpoints and adding styling.
3. Playable deck generator.

#### NOTES:

This was a really fun project to work on. Given I had not played pokémon in decades, it felt like a trip down nostalgia lane. I had to do a lot of research and testing to make sure the cards were displayed correctly, but I'm happy with the final product. I am looking forward to talking about the challenges I encountered when building this app :)
